Title: Implementation of simple Euler schemes and fourth-order Runge-Kutta methods for arbitrary first-order ODE systems
Version: 0.1.0

Description: Returns numerical solutions to basic ODE problems, e.g. the SIR model for infectious diseases.
    Can also handle generic first-order systems of ODEs. Finally, it includes a simple numerical solver for the novel 
    SIDARTHE model developed in Italy to study the COVID-19 pandemic. The solver can use either the basic Euler scheme or the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method.
